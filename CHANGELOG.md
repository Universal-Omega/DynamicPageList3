# Version 3.0.1
Many thanks to GreenReaper on GitHub for reporting and finding issues with core functionality that previously went unreported.

* Code quality improvements.  Various changes to squash E_NOTICE errors helped find unnoticed issues.
* The "headingmode" functionality was not previously repaired from the code rework.  It is now fixed.
* Removed an unused $logger in the DynamicPageList class.
* Category depth recursion was broken.  #41
* New timestamp handling functionality caused unexpected behavior.  It has been reverted to work the same as the previous implementation.  #40
* Parse time profiling was broken.
* Scroll direction parameter was broken.
* Early parsing was accidentally clearing minor warnings and errors preventing them from being seen.
* Category links relied on Mediawiki functionality that ended up causing double parsing and potentially broken links on some wiki setups.  This is now handled all in the extension to reduce the number of parses and ensure links are valid.  #38
* Article processing would clear the number of query results causing an issue in which blank output would be produced when all articles were excluded from the output.  This has been fixed to display a warning for no results.
* Databases that use table prefixes were broken due to a few bugged selects.  #37  Thanks to @nsradke for reporting this issue.

# Version 3.0.2
* Fixed issues with usedby parameter causing fatal errors.
* Fixed issue where the allrevisionssince would display a blank [[User:|]] link despite not being specified to show user information.

  * https://gitlab.com/hydrawiki/extensions/DynamicPageList/issues/44
* Preliminary support for Mediawiki 1.25+ wfLoadExtension() style extension loading.  Current implementation is broken due to extension design issues that need fixed.

	* https://gitlab.com/hydrawiki/extensions/DynamicPageList/issues/44#issuecomment-129951800

# Version 3.0.4
* Added functionality to enable recursive tag parsing when using the <dpl> parser tag.

# Version 3.0.8
* Changed instances of $dplSettings in language strings to $wgDplSettings.
* Moved the DPL template installation to the database updater.  Previously this was done on every page load and would also interfere with Special:Import.
* Fixed end resets and eliminates being flipped for what context(function or tag) they should run.
* DPL will no longer handle the raw <section> tag outside of the DPL context by default.  It will still handle <section> tags found inside a DPL context.
	* New setting: $wgDplSettings['handleSectionTag'], default of false.  Set this to true for the old broken behavior.
